# SAP Extended Warehouse Management - Improvement Chrome Extension 

## What is does?
Normally for a SAP consultant to be aware of what new improvements have been released for a particular product he has to refer multiple resources. We thought why can't we automate it. As soon as something new is released we shall be made aware of it, so that is where we decided to write an extension. The extension once installed keep checking at regular interval if any improvements have been added to https://sapimprovementfinder.com related to EWM if yes show a notification.The intent of sharing this repo is Consultants can reuse the template and customize it based on their need.
